# Story Text-generator-using-genai

Welcome to the "Story Text Generator", a project that leverages Generative AI to create engaging and imaginative stories. This repository contains the code, dataset, and instructions for fine-tuning a language model to generate creative stories.

🎯 Features
- Generates unique stories based on a given prompt.
- Supports customization of story genres, lengths, and themes.
- Fine-tuned using state-of-the-art NLP models like GPT-2 or GPT-3.
- Easy-to-use interface for both developers and end-users.


 📂 Project Structure

- `dataset/`: Contains training data in text format (e.g., story prompts and completions).
- `models/`: Stores pre-trained and fine-tuned model weights.
- `scripts/`: Includes scripts for training, fine-tuning, and inference.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis and testing.
- *`app/`: Frontend or API code (if applicable).

🚀 Getting Started
 Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8 or higher.
2. Install dependencies:

Using the Generator
Generate a story based on a prompt:
python scripts/generate_story.py --prompt "Once upon a time..."
The generated story will be printed to the console or saved as a text file.

🛠️ Tools and Technologies
Python for programming.
Hugging Face Transformers for model fine-tuning.
Pandas & NumPy for data preprocessing.
